This file contains the full changelog, see last part.

WARNING: Comskip can not and will never be able to process copy protected files.

WARNING: Avast will think Comskip is an unsafe program and force it to execute in a sandbox causing Comskip to crash. Tell Avast Comskip is safe.

WARNING: When Comskip crashes at startup you may need to install vcredist_x86.exe from
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en

VISTA, W7, W8 WARNING: Comskip has no valid embedded manifest. Please run comskip manually (double click comskip.exe) a first time and and  always allow it to run.

This, and older versions, can be downloaded from http://www.kaashoek.com/files/
The comskip support forum can be found at http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/

When you like Comskip do consider to donate! 
I pay for hosting the forum and the download server and spend considerable time to deliver good support.
Donation can be done from the comskip home page at http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/

If you are not an expert I recommend to use verbose=10 as maximum, any value from 0 to 12 is possible.

Remember that more detection methods (such as 255) is NOT always better.

Installation:


For GBPVR copy comskip.exe, comskip.ini into the gbpvr root directory.
In some situations comskip is not able to find its ini file. Try setting verbose=10 to check if it works. If this fails, copy the ini file in your system32 directory or in the directory containing the mpeg files to be processed

Dirmon2 requires the Comskip commandline option for finding the ini file. Otherwise Comskip will have terrible performance

SagetTV users may consider using SJQ http://forums.sage.tv/forums/showthread.php?t=25147

HideRun.exe can be used to run Comskip without showing the console window.
Usage: HideRun "path to comskip.exe" "parameters for comskip"
Hiderun requires .net to be installed

For other PVR solutions you may consider using Comskip Monitor (google)

All parameters for comskip can be set in the comskip.ini file. The file comskip.txt lists and describes all possible parameters. If you need a parameter that is currently not in your ini file simply copy the line from comskip.txt and add to comskip.ini

Upgrading
Copy comskip.exe over your old files (you might save the old version ;-)) 
Please start from the included ini file or use your old ini file
Read manual.htm, tuning.htm and comskip.txt for more information

Use ComskipGUI.exe to see what Comskip is doing when processing a file. Drag and drop the file to be processed on ComskipGUI.exe

Changes in 0.79.110
- Added the output file for DVRMS Toolbox, enable with output_dvrmstb=1 in the ini file. A second commandline parameter can be used to specify the directory where the dvrmstb xml file should be written. Setting live_tv=1 will also have this xml file updated during scanning.
Changes in 0.79.109
- Improved the blackframe detection during live_tv processing
Changes in 0.79.108
- Changed the dvrmsstandoff algoritm. For a 8MBit/second recording you should use live_tv_retries=300, The higher the bitrate the lower the retries.
Changes in 0.79.107
- Added the dvrmsstandoff parameter for dvr-ms, default is dvrmsstandoff=120000, set dvrmsstandoff to the amount of kilobytes to stay from the end of the file when processing during recording. Make sure you set live_tv_retries high enough to allow the buffer to fill while waiting.
Changes in 0.79.106
- Increased the waiting time for the writing of dvr-ms files during live tv, set live_tv_retries=4 or higher if needed
Changes in 0.79.105
- Bug solved: Removed the bug that was introduced in build 104
Changes in 0.79.104: Do not use build 104!!!!!!!
- The default comskip.ini file is not very agressive, I changed the settings to be more agressive. If you start to miss parts of the show revert back to the comskip.ini that is in build 103
- Bug solved: Invoking comskipGUI.exe without any arguments could cause Comskip to crash.
- Bug created: Build 104 will ALWAYS display the debugwindow, even when called as a hidden process
Do use build 102 or earlier

Changes in 0.79.97
- Improved logo recognition
- When enable_mencoder_pts=1 is set in the ini file the generated .EDL file will use the PTS information for the cutpoints to support mencoder. Does ony work for TS files. Running comskip on the .CSV file will always be done as if enable_mencoder_pts=0
Changes in 0.79.96
- Bug solved: The executable name generated with output_mpeg2schnitt=1 was incorrect and the mpeg2schnitt_options did not work

Changes in 0.79.75
- Bug solved: Sometimes audio and video run out of sync during processing.
Changes in 0.79.74
- Bug fixed: Inconsistent frame numbers between normal processing and previewing on certain files.
Changes in 0.79.73
- Added a separate executable for using the DebugWindow ComskipGUI.exe, no longer needed to edit the shortcut for activating the debugwindow, simply drag and drop onto ComskipGUI.exe
- New cutpoint detection method: CutScenes, method number 128
First record one or more frames to be used as cutscene by running ComskipGUI on the MPEG, move to the frame you want to use as cutscene and hit 'C'. Select where you want the frame to be saved.
Then use up to 8 cutsceneframes in your ini file
cutscenefile1="C:\\Work\\cutscene1.dmp"
cutscenefile2="C:\\Work\\cutscene2.dmp"
Set the cutscene threshold higher if you have low quality video. 
cutscene_threshold=20
Using more cutscenes will slowdown Comskip, when cutscenes are enabled the Debugwindow will show in the pink line cutscene information instead of scene change information

- live_tv=1 works again
- Added delete_show_after_last_commercial to do what is says.
- Added a commandline option to set the logo file so a learned logo can be re-used. --logo=filename.logo.txt
- Multiple ini files can be used with the --ini=filename.ini commandline switch. Use --ini=comskip%2.ini in postprocessing.bat to have a per channel ini file.
- Added the possibility to review the output of comskip in the debugwindow. When finished positioning the mpeg is possible with cursor keys and mouse.

Changes in 0.74
- Corrected a bug that prevented the use of the minimum commercial size
- Improved the comparison with the reference file

Changes in 0.73
- Added sound processing
- Improved blackframe and logo processing which makes tuning less important.
- Speed has not improved due to the added processing.
- Framerate is now automatically read from the mpeg file, no need to set in the ini.
- Did a lot on the block algorithm which may not have improved the performance for you ;-)
- 

Changes in 0.72
- Fixed a bug causing noisy black frames not to be recognized, this can improve performance considerable!
- Changed the CSV file to use ';' as separator so you can load it into excel without conversion.

Changes in 0.71
- Many changes in the log file, most specific in the final block list, hope you like it!

Changes in 0.70
- Any frame with a non_uniformity below the threshold will be used as a cut point. So pur blue or pure white will work. Default is 100.
- A show_percentile below about 0.2 will be added to the logo_percentile to get the real show_percentile. Usefulle for shows that take some time before the logo appears
- Determining show/commercials for a recording without logo with many very darks scenes is not working, but then I don't know how this will ever work. 
- Some improvements in the log file (mostly for myself).

Changes 0.69
- About 25% faster then comskip 0.64
- Logo learning is substantial more robust leading to much better logo recognition
- The written framearray now also shows the (aspect_ratio-1)*100
- Corrected some stupid errors that where leading to a bad performance.
- The show_percentile is automatically calculated from the logo_percentage when sufficient logo is found.
- experimental code for settings generating cutpoints before and after a logo, value is in seconds, should be 10 or bigger, 0 disables
- have installed automatic regression testing on a test set of 10 shows to prevent future stupid errors 

Changes 0.68
- The written framearray can not be read back!!! You can import it in a spreadsheet to do extensive evaluation of blackframe detection, logo detection and aspect ratio detection
- The written framearray now includes the variable "uniform" that shows the quality of the black frames.
- The saved logo file combines horizontal and vertical edges in one presentation. Should be easier to read
- Ascpect Ratio changes do generate candidate cutpoints
- Logo processing shows time before logo appears and time after logo disappearing.
- Scene Change detection seems to be based on wrong assumptions, please do not use it.
- Debug level above 2 shows the Long/Short block ratio per long block to support blackframe detection tuning. The ratio should be above 50 percent.

Changes 0.67
- Fixed the bug that prevented the scene change rate to be used in the calculation
- Now logo's at the right side of the screen are also detected
- A new parameter for the ini files is added ar_split, it sets the ration above which it is assumed to be widescreen
  If you see too many AR segments increase the minimum commercial length

No dictonary is included, please use your old one.
The comskip.ini included is mine, please adapt it to your settings!!!!!!
